# **The Problem**

Modern AF/Space Force missions rely on distributed data across aircraft, satellites, ground nodes, and autonomous systems.  
Current validation methods fail under:

- **Contested / denied bandwidth (DDIL)**
- **High-latency tactical networks**
- **Zero-trust cross-domain data flows**
- **High-volume sensor / mission data**
- **C2 nodes operating under EW pressure**

**Operational consequence:** Mission-critical data cannot be trusted or validated fast enough for real-time decisions.

> **Use-Case Snapshot:** A 20-satellite LEO constellation must validate crosslink telemetry even under *70% bandwidth loss* and intermittent connectivity.

# **Our Innovation**

A next-generation **cryptographic validation layer** optimized for tactical, cyber, and space environments.

**Dual-Use Commercialization Intent**
This technology is intentionally designed as a dual-use product. Providing military-grade distributed validation for missions, while also addressing commercial demand for secure, low-bandwidth consensus in sectors such as telecommunications, distributed cloud, fintech/Web3 infrastructure, autonomous robotics, and satellite communications. Phase I will develop the foundation for a commercial-ready, revenue-generating product that aligns with both DoD mission needs and high-growth commercial markets.

## **Phase II Vision – Hybrid RSA + SNARK + Vector Commitment Engine**

In Phase II we extend the system with:

- **SNARKs** for succinct, compressible proofs  
- **Vector commitments** for scalable, batched integrity checks  
- **Hybrid accumulators** for sublinear communication  
- **Zero-knowledge mission integrity validation**  

### **Objective**
Deliver **ultra-lightweight, zero-trust distributed integrity** for tactical, cyber, and space systems operating in degraded environments.

### **Mission Fit**
- UAV swarm coordination  
- SATCOM integrity (LEO/MEO/C2 relay)  
- Space domain awareness  
- Multi-domain sensor fusion  
- Cross-domain cyber operations
