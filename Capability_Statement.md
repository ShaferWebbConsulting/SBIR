## **DIFFERENTIATORS**

### **Ultra-Low Communication Overhead**
Up to **10×+ reduction** in proof traffic compared to Merkle-based RBC, enabling high-performance validation in contested bandwidth environments.

### **Ready Prototype with Real Results**
- End-to-end working prototype in Rust  
- AWS experiments across 5–32+ distributed nodes  
- Measured throughput, latency, and resource profiles  
- Plots, figures, and reproducible test harness  

### **Zero-Trust by Design**
All validation is cryptographic; no trusted nodes required — ideal for cyber, space, and tactical mission sets.

### **Path to Space-Scale Validation**
Phase II integrates **SNARKs + vector commitments** for sublinear, succinct, mission-ready distributed integrity.
