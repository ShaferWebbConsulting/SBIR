# ✅ The Problem (Air Force & Space Force)

Modern Air Force and Space Force operations rely on distributed data from aircraft, satellites, ground stations, and autonomous platforms.

But today’s validation methods break down under:

- Limited or contested bandwidth (DDIL)  
- High-node-count distributed systems  
- Zero-trust cross-domain environments  
- High-frequency mission and sensor data  
- Latency-sensitive C2 operations  

This creates **dangerous delays**, degraded mission performance, and reduced trust in distributed operational systems.

# ✅ Our Innovation

A next-generation **cryptographic validation layer** designed for tactical, cyber, and space environments.

## Phase I Capability (Ready Today): RSA Accumulator–Based Consensus Layer

Our proven prototype includes:

- Rust-based asynchronous consensus  
- RSA accumulator validation  
- 10×+ communication reduction over Merkle/RBC approaches  
- AWS scaling experiments with real plots and figures  
- Robust performance under distributed load  

### Why It Matters to AF/Space Force
It provides:

- Constant-size proofs  
- Fast verification  
- Low communication overhead  
- Resilience in contested/low-bandwidth environments  

Ideal for:

- Cyber defense  
- UAV swarms  
- C2 nodes  
- Spacecraft crosslinks  
- Distributed sensing

## Phase II Vision: Hybrid RSA + SNARK + Vector Commitment Engine

Phase II extends the system to incorporate:

- **SNARKs** for succinct proof compression  
- **Vector commitments** for scalable batch verification  
- **Hybrid accumulators** for sublinear communication  
- **Zero-knowledge integrity checks** for DDIL environments  

### Objective
Achieve **ultra-lightweight, zero-trust distributed data integrity** for high-threat operational environments.

### Applicable Missions
- UAV swarm coordination  
- SATCOM integrity  
- Space domain awareness  
- Multi-domain sensor fusion  
- Zero-trust cyber operations
